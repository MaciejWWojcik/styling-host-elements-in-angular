## Techniques to style component host element

Styling the host element is a crucial ability that could potentially save you lines of code. Still, what's more
important, it could completely change the way you develop reusable components, making their code clear and easier to
maintain. There are many methods of making component templates dynamic based on the context of use - here I will
concentrate on techniques that use CSS styles and reduce Typescript logic.

## Techniques used

- `HostBinding` decorator
- `:host` pseudo-class selector
- `:host-context` pseudo-class selector
